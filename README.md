The application can create and modify .json to use them as a map

to open existing file type 'O' in the console and type the name file
to create new file type 'n' in the console and give the information about width and height
to move around the map use w, s, a, d
to show or hide brush menu click TAB
to save project click F12 and write file name in the console


By changing:
- "speed" value you can move faster around the screen
- "ts" value you modify width and height, rendered tile size ( but the optimal value is 32 because sprites are not scalable yet)
